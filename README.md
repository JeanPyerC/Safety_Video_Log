# Safety Video Log

The company’s goal was to make sure all employees watches the safety video. Managers will have to find time to bring their entire staff to watch the safety video which will make an impact on our day-to-day task. Not only that, when they are given the responsibility to watch on their own time, survey showed that a high number of employees forgot to watch the video. 

The purpose of this task is to make sure all employees watch the safety video. In order to do this, I created this shared macro excel file. By sharing the link to all the employees, they are able to open it, fill-out their information, and watch the video. At the same time, we are storing the information they filled out to record it. 

**2. What information do they store?**  
  - They store their basic information such as first name, last name, and what department they are working in. After submitting their information. Once they click on submit, the macro will automatically open the video. 

**3. How is it stored?**  
  - Once they submit their information, it gets stored in a separate sheet. The sheet can only be seen by certain employees, however, in the GitHub, it’s accessible to everyone. 

**3. Why is this important?**  
  - It’s important to record the employees who’s watching it.  With this data, we were able to create a quick report to show the percentage of the department who completed it.
